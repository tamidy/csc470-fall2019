Animal Allies

I am going to create a game that involves taking care of a pet companion by feeding, cradling, playing with, ignoring, and petting it. The user will be able to choose from these actions through buttons on the user interface. The user will have a choice of what kind of pet they want (rabbit, dog, cat, bird, fish, hamster, or lizard). This idea is implementing a basic AI using a state machine. The pet will have different reactions to these gestures, such as hunger, happiness, sadness, sleepiness, and boredom, which will be represented as meters. There will also be a private timer in the code keeping track of the amount of time has passed since the last time the user fed it, which it will respond to with hunger, sadness, sleepiness, and boredom. Sleepiness and boredom can be improved by using a berry that the user can buy from the store.

When using the state machine, the pet may have a mixture of reactions to an action, so I'll have to assign appropriate reactions to the user's actions using mathematical implementations and considering the mix of emotions the pet is feeling at any given moment. For example, the pet might get more sad when its more sleepy. The user will be able to name their pet once they choose their type of pet on the home screen.

I will also apply a leveling up feature that the user can earn for taking good care of their pet, such as having the pet grow in size, change appearance (mature), and getting money (the money will accumulate as the user gets higher in level). The user can level up by getting their pet’s happiness to 100 three times, and sadness, hunger, sleepiness, and boredom to 0 three times. There will be five levels total.

The user will have an inventory of toys, food, and water. There will be a store where the user can use the money they earn from leveling up to buy different kinds of toys, food, and water for their pet. The store will have the typical store background music. 

I want the user interface to be easy to use and resemble the pet animal games on the Nintendo DS, Petz. A bright color-scheme and home-like environments will be the basic aesthetic of the game. Each pet will have its own “room” or environment for the user to take care of it. For example, a lizard may live in a cage that resembles with water and dirt, whereas a rabbit will live in a cage with bedding. The different pets will also have different food preferences and toys. For example, a dog would like a bone toy that they could bite and dog biscuits as a treat, whereas a cat would like a ball of yarn and tuna. The audio will be cute, bouncy, peaceful background music, since this is a game without a battle aspect, which would require intense battle music. 
 
I am going to have to figure out how to clearly express the way the pet is feeling so users can apply the appropriate action. I also want the pet to have appropriate reactions to the users actions. For example, I could use the particle effect to animate “Z” ‘s coming out of the pet when it’s sleeping, or hearts when the user pets it. Some other animations include the pet breathing and walking around the room on its own with the camera following it. 

The user can “win” the game by completing all five levels, in which they unlock a “Best Friends” status. The user will then return to the homepage and any pet that they have unlocked “Best Friends” status will be specified on the UI.

Low Bar: Getting 4 pets done, getting their state machines to work, designing their settings, the user can name their pet, applying the level-up feature (giving the user money), applying background music, making the store and inventory feature, the pet moves on its own with the camera following it, and winning the game without saving it.

Target: Getting all 7 pets done, getting their state machines to work (considering all emotions when the pet reacts to the user’s actions), designing their environments, the user can name their pet, applying the level-up feature (giving the user money and the pets grow and change appearance), applying background music, making the store and inventory feature, the pet moves on its own with the camera following it (with breathing animations), the animal has a particle effect as a reaction to the user input, and winning the game with saving it. 

High Bar: In addition to meeting the target, the particle effect could take place whenever the pet reaches a certain state, rather than only when the user interacts with it. The user can call their pet’s name and it will come to them. Instead of a single room, the setting can be an entire house, including a kitchen, living room, bedroom, and backyard.

Timeline: 

11/18 - establish color scheme, format the UI, code state machine, build environments, naming the pet 

11/21 - particle effects, store, inventory, berries (update state machine)

11/25 - building the title screen, adding music, level-up feature 

11/28 - consider critiques and apply them to the game, get caught up if needed 

12/2 - animations, camera movement 

12/5 - saving the game, updating the title screen 

12/9 - build web, final testing 

12/12 - due date
